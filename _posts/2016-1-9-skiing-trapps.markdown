<h1>The Time Lapse Adventure</h1>
Traveling to Vermont over New Years we celebrated the transition form 2015-2016 with two separate trips up Round Top at the Trapp Family Lodge. Below is a compilation of all the time lapses I took during both days of adventure.

<h1>Day 1: The First Ascent</h1>
Molly and I went with Dad, Neil, and Maddi on a mission to reach the Cabin before it closed at 3:30. It was an ambitious goal seeing as Dad and Maddi had only XC-skied a couple times before and it was Neil's first time. Molly decided to take the opportunity to practice her skate skiing, which meant that everyone else got to watch her produce her best impression of a labrador retriever: flying to the far reaches of our lines of site and then returning briefly enough for a quick hello before flying off again. We're fairly certain she completed the climb 2-3 times in total distance using this method.

Dad, Neil, and Maddi took quite naturally to the skiing and caught on quickly to the skiing on the easier beginner loop. The warning sign for Expert Terrain at the bottom of picnic knoll did not faze them and we semi-rapidly ascended towards the cabin. With everyone's best herring bone technique we managed to get to the cabin by 2:45. We enjoyed some soup, sandwiches, and cookies. It was great fortification for the descent. As expected, it was challenging, but we were all able to make it down with some creative techniques.

<h1>Day 2: Lilly Joins the Skiing</h1>
For the second adventure, Lilly decided to join Molly and I for another trip up to the cabin. This time it was a two pronged journey, with Molly, Lilly, and I skiing up, while Mom and Dad snowshoed. After a couple laps in the beginner loop, skate skis did not treat my shins well, we blew right past the the expert terrain sign and decided to take the Owl's Howl. Lilly took naturally to the ascent and we were able to make it to the cabin shortly after Mom and Dad to enjoy a much needed lunch. Lilly descended with impressive skill and managed to ski, without creative techniques, all the way down.
